<h1>HUD Examples/h1>

This project contains several examples on how to use a re-usable CommonJS module to create a HUD or Status Indicator window/dialog.

These are common components I use in a few of my projects, and thought others might find then useful as well.

<h3>About the examples</h3>

* app.js - Cross-platform example using a HUD window CommonJS module
* android_dialog_example.js - example on how to use the HUD Dialog CommonJS module on Android. Please note this is only available on Android
